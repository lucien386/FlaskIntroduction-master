# MusicXML2ABCNotationWebApp

This is my personal project. It aims to provide a web service to convert between different music sheet format, which, in this case, MusicXML to ABCNotation. The app is hosted on Amazon Web Service Elastic Beanstalk.

Thank you to https://wim.vree.org/svgParse/xml2abc.html for making this possible. I will write my own version in C++ in the future.
